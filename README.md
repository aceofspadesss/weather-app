## Project Description

This project is a simple weather app application that allows you to check weather forecast and current weather in any place of the world.
The project relies on Open Weather API which keeps weather records, while callback is managed by Axios. 
For layout I used Bootstrap 4 as well as my own media queries and CSS styling.
You might also notice i18n library, which I will use for adding localization to the project in the upcoming update.

## Components

All the components can be found in "./src/components". Each of the component has its' own role:

App - Main component that handles layout and API requests. <br/>
Forecast - Responsible for providing forecast data based on the longitude and latitude data provided Open Weather. <br/>
Navbar - Handles theme debug menu. <br/>
SearchBar - Provides user input value for API requests. <br/>
WeatherToday - Displays current weather data. <br/>

## Cards

All of the forecast cards can be flipped on click for additional information such as humidity, wind speed, pressure and cloudness.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Downloads all the necessary dependencies to run this project.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
